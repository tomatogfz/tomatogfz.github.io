Comp 20 - Homework #1
===========================

I had a lot of fun to build this website. 

There are 3 HTML file as requested (index.html, bio.html, resume.html) and from the main page you can get access to the later two pages.

I have one CSS file for the index.html, which contains more than 10 rules. In the CSS file I created some classes to precisely control the styling. I also practised how to apply google font, how to pick up my favorite color, etc. in CSS. 

Also, I put a link to another website of mine (fangzhengguo.com) which I got several month ago, but I don't know much about Web Design at that time. By taking Comp 20, I am very confident to make it much better in the future.

I get lots of inspirations from Kate's Example and by looking at some most famous personal website. There is plenty room to improve.

Thanks,
Fangzheng Guo
