	<h1>My Bio</h1>

<p>
	Experiencing at the moment is hard, but when it becomes memory, it feels like heaven. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	This is the true picture of my college life. With outstanding performance in high school, I entered Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics without taking Chinese College Entrance Examination. Back then I was confident and hopeful and firmly believed I was much cooler than Tom Cruise in TopGun, because I was going to design airplanes! 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	However, in reality, college is a place of eagle boiling. It discovers a true you and it tests your loyalty towards dream. Facing constantly exposed shortcomings and unexpected reality, I grow mature and wise in suffering.</p>
